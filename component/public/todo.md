pages on file system!!!!

--------------

page builder as form input option (lightweight!)
rich text as form input

form input that triggers "on change" > can make it part of a table

V condition renders on cells (e.g. only render something if the state has some value)

V centralize condition resolution, need to switch from eval() to function asap

row styling that makes it a table
	> aponet
	> with each cell a field
need simple "actions"? (as fragment) (tabs > maybe rename to "actions"?)
	> part of fields?
		> can send out any (complex) part of state
need icon stuff in fields (as fragment)

add "description" to form fields which allows (in small) to add a description to a field, explaining for example the password policy
	> can alternatively do this as an n-info?
