when exposing text tag as separate component
	> allow to set type (h1, h2, ...)

have everything as pluggable, except form
	have everything in form pluggable as well though

--------------

- dynamic components...

- mapping voorzien voor enumeration service (als extra input parameters buiten q)
- 
- allow images to be dropped in resources folder (for static images)
	> have a tiny gallery of images available in the folder (and deletability)


- switch from eval() to function (see mdn for eval entry)
--------------

page builder as form input option (lightweight!)
rich text as form input

form input that triggers "on change" > can make it part of a table

row styling that makes it a table
	> aponet
	> with each cell a field
need simple "actions"? (as fragment) (tabs > maybe rename to "actions"?)
	> part of fields?
		> can send out any (complex) part of state
need icon stuff in fields (as fragment)

add "description" to form fields which allows (in small) to add a description to a field, explaining for example the password policy
	> can alternatively do this as an n-info?
